What if the world u known has vanished?

You wake up alone in the ruins of a building where the plants took over the bricks, with no memory of how you got here. All you have are your instincts and your arms. Around you, a huge silence is broken only by distant sounds of explosions.

Every decision counts.
Explore abandoned buildings, take risks to survive, and face the threats of a world where weakness means death. Choose wisely: your strength, endurance, intelligence, and weapon skills will be your only allies.

But be aware, your choices have consequences.
One wrong move could cost you your life. A simple detour could lead you to safety or into a deadly trap.

Your goal? Reach a secure building where helicopters are evacuating survivors. To get there, youâ€™ll need to navigate a hostile landscape, face strange creatures, and avoid armed drones.

In this immersive text-based adventure, you write your own story. Every choice leads to a unique path, bringing you closer or further of the end.

Will you survive the apocalypse?
